      <h2>Competition</h2>
      <p>
        ENPH 253 is the classic UBC Engineering Physics robot design course. 
        Each summer, students work in teams to build fully autonomous robots capable of completing a themed challenge. 
        In 2023, the scenario was a <strong>burning pet shelter</strong>: our robot had two minutes to rescue as many 
        stuffed animal “pets” as possible from a hazard-filled building and bring them to safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        The course surface featured ramps, a raised floor, obstacles, a chute, and multiple hiding spots for the pets. 
        Robots had to autonomously navigate the taped path, locate and recover the pets, and deposit them safely outside. 
        The competition was head-to-head, with two robots running simultaneously on mirrored surfaces.

      <h2>Construction</h2>
      <p>
        Our robot went through many stages of prototyping and redesign before reaching the final build. 
        We started with rough mechanical prototypes, refined the chassis in CAD, and iterated until we had a working 
        design that could handle the course requirements.

      <h2>Electrical</h2>
      <p>
        The electrical system was designed around custom PCBs and modular wiring for reliability. 
        We integrated sensors, motor drivers, and a central microcontroller. 
        Below are the circuit diagram and one of our final PCBs.

      <h2>Code</h2>
      <p>
        The software controlled motor actuation, sensor feedback, and decision-making for navigating the course. 
        It was written in C and C++, with a focus on reliability and modularity so that we could test individual systems 
        (motors, sensors, routines) before integrating everything.
