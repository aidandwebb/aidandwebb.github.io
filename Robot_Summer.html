      <h2>Competition</h2>
      <p>
        This summer I got to take part in the annual Engineering Physics Robot Summer competition and it was arguably
        the most interesting, challenging and absolutely enjoyable thing I have ever had the pleasure of enduring. Every 
        year the competition takes place there is a new theme and for us the scenario was a <strong>burning pet shelter</strong>:
        our robot had two minutes to rescue as many stuffed animal pets from the course, a hazard-filled building and bring them back
        to a safe zone.

      <h2>Construction</h2>
      <p>
        I got to learn so much about the design process throughout this course, we started with really quick "shape" prototypes,
        where the main idea was to just get a feel for the robots general form, this is where rapidly being able to cutout shapes
        on the laser cutter came in handy. Afterwards the same laser cutting techniques were used to make our finished chassis and
        also extended to designing parts that could be made on the waterjet.

      <h2>Electrical</h2>
      <p>
        The electrical system taught me a ridiculous amount about the nature of debugging, from parasitic capacitance to
        noise propagating through the ground planes on the pcb there were so many small things I picked up. Truly the 
        realization that the lumped linear circuits model I was taught in my circuit analysis classes is just a model is a
        fun but painful lesson to take. For the robot I got experience working with KiCad aswell as using tools like my 
        wavegen and oscillascope to debug. I also certainly inhaled a fair amount of solder fumes but hopefully it wont 
        hurt my average too much in the coming semesters.

      <h2>Code</h2>
      <p>
        We maintained a very object oriented approach when it came to software, I don't exactly have a picture to put here
        (looking at C++ is sometimes a tad boring.) But I can definitely say that the idea of trying to make code for all your
        componants into a black box is a wonderful ideology for a programmer to have and one I definitely got to implement over
        the course of this project.
